# Taipei_Tower
Math Project for University in Sophomore year : 
This Code is a mathematical project we had to do during my sophomore year in college for my Bsc in Mechanical Engineering.
Basically, we had to use different mathematical methods to solve a linear differential equation to the second order which represents the position of a spring
in the Taipei Tower which goal is to compensate the vibrations caused to the structure of the building of an earthquake. To approximate to the closest possible the polynomial
expression we used 3 methods : Euler's, Runge-Kutta 2 (Modified Euler) and Runge-Kutta 4.
